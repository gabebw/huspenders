# huspenders

It's the Haskell version of [suspenders].

[suspenders]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/suspenders

Huspenders creates a Cabal-based project with some sane defaults.

It assumes you want to create an executable, not a library.

## Installation

If you're on OS X:

Tap the Homebrew formulae repo, one time:

    $ brew tap gabebw/formulae
    
And install:

    $ brew install huspenders
    
You can also install the absolute latest version:

    $ brew install --HEAD huspenders

Otherwise, download the script.
