# huspenders

It's the Haskell version of [suspenders].

[suspenders]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/suspenders

Huspenders creates a Cabal-based project with some sane defaults.

It assumes you want to create an executable, not a library.

## Installation

If you're on OS X:

  $ brew tap gabebw/formulae # one time
  $ brew install huspenders

Otherwise, download the script.
